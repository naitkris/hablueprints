    # ↕️ Temperature and Humidity Change Notifications & Actions

    **Version: 1.0**

    Monitors all temperature and humidity sensors and triggers an action when
    any of them changes (increases or decreases) by a significant amount within
    a configurable time period in minutes (amount changed and minutes are both
    configurable). This is useful for detecting sudden environmental changes,
    device malfunctions, when the temperature and/or humidity changes due to
    opened doors/windows, to act as a heat alarm, etc.

    You can also choose any temperature or humidity sensors that should be ignored
    by this automation.
